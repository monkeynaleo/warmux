Wormux 0.5
Compilation/Installation under Linux
-----------------------------------

==========
* Dependencies
==========

If the following software is not presently on your system, you will need to download them
before attempting to install Wormux 0.5 on your computer...

* ClanLib
----------

Wormux (as of 13/11/2004) needs the ClanLib library - ("0.7 subversion" version)

This version can be downloaded of their website: http://www.clanlib.org/


* libxml++
----------

Wormux uses the libxml++ library (version 1.0).

Get it here: http://libxmlplusplus.sourceforge.net/

Under Debian, use the command:
	apt-get install libxml++1.0-dev


===============
* Compilation / Installation
===============

Under Linux, enter the Wormux directory, then simply type:

	./configure
	make
	
then, as root, type:
	
	make install

By default, the game is installed in /usr/local. But you can specify another
directory (useful if you don't have access to the root account) by modifying the
initial configure command:

	./configure --prefix=/OTHER/DIRECTORY/HERE


=========
* Uninstalling
=========

To uninstall Wormux, go to the source directory, then (as root):

	make uninstall


==========
* Other options
==========

Many options can be used with the configure command.
The most useful (for developers, at least) being:

	./configure --enable-debug

This enables you to compile Wormux with debug options, allowing you to track down bugs/other problems.

To get a list of all the other configuration options, type:

	./configure --help
