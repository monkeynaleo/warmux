Wormux
FAQ (English)
-------------------
Hopefully, this document provides the answer to any problems you may have encountered in Wormux.


* I get the message "Floating point exception" as soon as I run Wormux.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This problem is encountered mostly by laptops with
an Intel i8xx graphic card. The solution is to edit your
/etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/X11/XF86Config file and to add (or modify) 
the line:

Section "ServerFlags"
[...]
Option "DisableVidModeExtension" "yes"


* Error "resource (...) not found"
---------------------------------

If you get a message like:

<< UNE EXCEPTION EST INTERVENUE (pas de bol) :
   Resource ico_arme/suicide not found. >>

This is because Wormux has not been run from the correct directory. If you are working
with the source code, go to the root wormux directory, then type ./wormux.
Otherwise, you can specify in the file ~/.wormux/config.xml where the Wormux data
files reside.

The best method is to install Wormux by typing "make install" as root user in the wormux subdirectory
"src/". Then delete the source code folder (unless you want to uninstall Wormux later).


* Other errors?

See the file "BUGS.txt" which explains how to contact us about any other errors.
