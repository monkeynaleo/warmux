Wormux
FAQ (English)
-------------------
Hopefully, this document provides the answer to any problems you may have encountered in Wormux.


* I get 2 frames per second, though I have a P4 1.2GHz ?!?
--------------------------------------------------------

Wormux uses OpenGL texture functions to display pictures on the
screen. So on computers without graphics acceleration, everything is computed
by the video driver, and processor is overloaded.
The solution is to use SDL functions instead of the OpenGL ones, but the SDL functions
are not fully implemented in ClanLib yet, so any contribution is welcome!


* I get the message "Floating point exception" as soon as I run Wormux.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This problem is encountered mostly by laptops with
an Intel i8xx graphic card. The solution is to edit your
/etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/X11/XF86Config file and to add (or modify) 
the line:

Section "ServerFlags"
[...]
Option "DisableVidModeExtension" "yes"


* Error "connection refused by server" (Linux)
-------------------------------------

If you get a message like:

<< Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
   Xlib: No protocol specified

   UNE EXCEPTION EST INTERVENUE (pas de bol) :
   Failed to open display. No XWindow display available. >>

It is almost certainly because you are running Wormux as a different user than the one
with which you have run the graphical server (typically, you are root instead
of a regular user). 

You should either switch to the correct user, or authorise root to launch 
graphical software by typing "xhost -"

(WARNING: this second method is not very secure!)


* Error "resource (...) not found"
---------------------------------

If you get a message like:

<< UNE EXCEPTION EST INTERVENUE (pas de bol) :
   Resource ico_arme/suicide not found. >>

This is because Wormux has not been run from the correct directory. If you are working
with the source code, go to the root wormux directory, then type ./wormux.
Otherwise, you can specify in the file ~/.wormux/config.xml where the Wormux data
files reside.

The best method is to install Wormux by typing "make install" as root user in the wormux subdirectory
"src/". Then delete the source code folder (unless you want to uninstall Wormux later).


* Other errors?
