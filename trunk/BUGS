                                [ Wormux BUGS ]


  Wormux is a program written by humans, and so is bugged :-) But it's not
a fatality, you can help us to fix them by reporting them !


Bug reporting
=============

If the bug appears during compilation, type :
$ make | tee log.txt
and send to us log.txt file with your comments.

If the bug comes from the game, please use gdb (with debug version of Wormux) :
$ gdb ./wormux
(gdb) run
Error (...)
(gdb) where

And then copy/paste the error + what gdb answer to "where".


You can report us bugs by email (wormux-dev AT gna.org) or at our project
management website : https://gna.org/projects/wormux/
