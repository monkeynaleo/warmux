******************
Use of mac scripts
******************

For compile wormux you have to get some libraries

Some parts are commented, you can uncomment them if you need it.

You can see 3 scripts :
launch first.sh
fink.sh
macports.sh

You have to edit the first one, select if you prefer fink or macports (comment)
And select the good name for several tools.
Maybe you'll don't need to use the first, but just uncomment the fink or macports script,
but on my computer i need to do all exports in order to have fink release working.

Give me feedbacks about all this scripts

The XCode package have to be installed in order to have gcc and other staff.

Have fun :)
