                                [ Warmux BUGS ]


  Warmux is a program written by humans, and so has bugs :-) But it's not
fatal, you can help us to fix them by reporting them !


Bug reporting
=============

If the bug appears during compilation, type :
$ make 2>&1 | tee log.txt
and send to us log.txt file with your comments.

If the bug comes from the game, please use gdb (with debug version of Warmux) :
$ gdb ./warmux
(gdb) run
Error (...)
(gdb) where

And then copy/paste the error + what gdb answer to "where".


You can report us bugs by email (warmux-dev AT gna.org) or at our project
management website : https://gna.org/projects/warmux/
